## Project 3: Finding Donors for CharityML

### Project Description

This is the 3rd project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. In this project, I used sklearn and supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help a fictitious charity organization identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

Here, I first investigate the factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made. Then, I use a training and predicting pipeline to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency/speed of three supervised machine learning algorithms (GaussianNB, SVC, Adaboost). I then proceed to fine tune the parameters of the algorithm that provides the highest donation yield (while reducing mailing efforts/costs). Finally, I also explore the impact of reducing number of features in data.
